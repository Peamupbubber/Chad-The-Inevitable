# Chad: the inevitable

timed levels, multiple scenes per level, gain "time" with pick-up-able? use hides to not be seen.

tweak jumping on existing scripts, remove shooting. No enemies

Opening text: regular chad is effected by virus - you are the last person he needs to consume to become GigaChad

Return to his place of creation in order to stop the spread.. a rumor he started to get you to go to him

artist goals: make background music / sounds, make city scape art

NEED:
 - incorporate movement scripts
 - level design
 - Rain effects - cuts in and out (puzzle mech.)
 - Story (intro text / maybe find random story things?)
 - art maybeeee
 - sound maybeeee
 - interactables: buttons, moving doors, movable objects, etc.
 - Timer
 - start with developing scenes individually
